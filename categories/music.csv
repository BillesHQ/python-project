RIP IT UP AND START AGAIN is a celebration of what happened next.Post-punk bands like PiL, Joy Division, Talking Heads, The Fall and The Human League dedicated themselves to fulfilling punk's unfinished musical revolution. The post-punk groups were fervent modernists; whether experimenting with electronics and machine rhythm or adapting ideas from dub reggae and disco, they were totally confident they could invent a whole new future for music. ...more", "Music", "Five", "../../media/cache/81/7f/817f5089c0e6e62738dce2931e7323d3.jpg", "https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/rip-it-up-and-start-again_986/index.html",

This sweeping chronicle of music, politics, drugs, fear, loathing, and faith has been recognized as an indie rock classic in its own right. Among the bands profiled: Mission of Burma, Butthole Surfers, The Minutemen, Sonic Youth, Black Flag, Big Black, Hüsker Dü, Fugazi, Minor Threat, Mudhoney, The Replacements, Beat Happening, and Dinosaur Jr. ...more", "Music", "Three", "../../media/cache/ad/96/ad96e9c9f1664cbcb0e9627b007fb6f9.jpg", "https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/our-band-could-be-your-life-scenes-from-the-american-indie-underground-1981-1991_985/index.html",

In it he explores how profoundly music is shaped by its time and place, and he explains how the advent of recording technology in the twentieth century forever changed our relationship to playing, performing, and listening to music.Acting as historian and anthropologist, raconteur and social scientist, he searches for patterns—and shows how those patterns have affected his own work over the years with Talking Heads and his many collaborators, from Brian Eno to Caetano Veloso. Byrne sees music as part of a larger, almost Darwinian pattern of adaptations and responses to its cultural and physical context. His range is panoptic, taking us from Wagnerian opera houses to African villages, from his earliest high school reel-to-reel recordings to his latest work in a home music studio (and all the big studios in between).Touching on the joy, the physics, and even the business of making music, How Music Works is a brainy, irresistible adventure and an impassioned argument about music’s liberating, life-affirming power. ...more", "Music", "Two", "../../media/cache/1d/40/1d4087ff0a63f09fae9cd8433d21c2c4.jpg", "https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/how-music-works_979/index.html",
